# sparse-matrix
A sparse matrix solver recommendation system built using a support vector machine trained with features extracted from 860 sparse matrices and the time it took to solve them with different combinations of solvers and preconditioners available in PETSc (a toolkit for scientific computation). The system achieved 85.41\% accuracy for sequential solvers and 81.95\% for parallel solvers.
